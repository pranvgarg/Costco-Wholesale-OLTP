## Data Strategy

### Multiple Versions of Truth (MVoT)
Costco's data management leverages an MVoT approach, allowing each department (procurement, supply chain, finance, customer service) to analyze tailored datasets aligned with their goals. This supports specialized dashboards, facilitates scalability, and provides agility for business expansion.

### Hybrid Data Strategy (Defensive and Offensive)
Costco employs a hybrid data strategy:
- **Defensive**: Ensures accurate data management, compliance, optimal inventory levels, and customer/vendor data protection.
- **Offensive**: Expands e-commerce, employs dynamic pricing, personalized marketing, predictive analytics, and optimizes logistics to drive growth and market share.

- Processed through data wrangling and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis and theme identification.
- Linked to structured product and customer data for actionable insights and strategic decisions.

### Semistructured Data (Inventory Management)
- Includes restocking schedules, inventory levels, and order records.
- Integrated into structured databases using data wrangling tools.
- Supports real-time inventory analytics, predictive analytics, and supply chain optimization.
